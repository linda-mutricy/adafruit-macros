# Adafruit MacroPad RP2040
This is custom code for an Adafruit MacroPad based off of the official tutorial. It should make your life easier as you program and do basic work tasks.

I made this for myself, so the keyboard shortcuts are pretty focused on commonly-used operations in Chrome, Slack, and Visual Studio Code, but you can easily modify it for whatever you need.

## Potential Enhancements
- Adding a sleep mode (LEDs off, screen off) corresponding to the computer's sleep mode.
